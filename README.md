# Drop Down Sublime
A drop down window for Sublime Text.

This is a modification of Jonathon Rogers's (lonepie)
<a href="https://github.com/lonepie/mintty-quake-console">mintty-quake-console</a>, 
which is a drop down mintty console. He deserves all of the credit here. I
just changed things here and there to make it work with Sublime Text. :)

By default, the hotkey to toggle the window is <kbd>RWin</kbd>+<kbd>Backspace</kbd>. 
You can change it, as well as some other settings, in the file 
<strong><a href="https://github.com/JordanTHarris/DropDownSublime/blob/master/DropDownSublime.ini">DropDownSublime.ini</strong></a>.
Look at <a href="https://github.com/lonepie/mintty-quake-console">mintty-quake-console</a> 
for more details on that.
